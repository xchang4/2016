In this problem, we will prove that for any two sets $X$ and $Y$, $\overline{X \cup Y} = \overline{X} \cap \overline{Y}$. We will prove $\overline{X \cup Y} \subseteq \overline{X} \cap \overline{Y}$ in part (A) and $\overline{X} \cap \overline{Y} \subseteq \overline{X \cup Y}$ in part (B). If two sets are subsets of one another, then they must be equal!

\subproblem Consider an element $a \in \overline{X \cup Y}$ and prove $a \in \overline{X} \cap \overline{Y}$.
\subproblem Consider an element $b \in \overline{X} \cap \overline{Y}$ and prove $b \in \overline{X \cup Y}$.

\begin{solution}
\subsolution Consider an element $a \in \overline{X \cup Y}$. 

By the definition of complement, $\neg (a \in X \cup Y)$. 

By the definition of union, $\neg (a \in X \vee a \in Y)$. 

Using De Morgan's Law, $\neg (a \in X) \wedge \neg (a \in Y)$. 

By the definition of complement, $a \in \overline{X} \wedge a \in \overline{Y}$.

By the definition of intersection, $a \in \overline{X} \cap \overline{Y}$.
\subsolution Consider an element $b \in \overline{X} \cap \overline{Y}$.

By the definition of intersection, $b \in \overline{X} \wedge b \in \overline{Y}$.

By the definition of complement, $\neg (b \in X) \wedge \neg (b \in Y)$.

Using De Morgan's Law, $\neg (b \in X \vee b \in Y)$.

By the definition of union, $\neg (b \in X \cup Y)$.

By the definition of complement, $b \in \overline{X \cup Y}$.

Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets such that $|A| = n$ and $|B| = m$. What are the minimum and maximum sizes of each of the following sets? (Justify each answer in 1-2 sentences. No formal proof needed.)

\subproblem $A \cup B$
\subproblem $A \cap B$
\subproblem $A - B$
 
\begin{solution}
\subsolution If $A$ and $B$ have no elements in common, then their union contains all of the elements of $A$ and of $B$ with no overlap. The maximum size is therefore $n + m$. 

\noindent If the smaller of $A$ and $B$ is a subset of the larger, then their union is equal to the larger set. The minimum size is therefore $max(n, m)$.
\subsolution If the smaller of $A$ and $B$ is a subset of the larger, then their intersection is equal to the smaller set. The maximum size is therefore $min(n, m)$.

\noindent If $A$ and $B$ have no elements in common, then their intersection is the empty set. The minimum size is therefore 0.
\subsolution If $A$ and $B$ have no elements in common, then $A - B$ is simply equal to $A$ (since no elements are removed). The maximum size is therefore $n$.

\noindent If $A$ is a subset of $B$, then $A - B$ is the empty set (since $A - B$ consists of all elements of $A$which are not in $B$, and all of the elements of $A$ are in $B$). The minimum size is therefore 0.

Find a bijection between the set of all integers and the set of all natural numbers (including 0). Be sure to explain why your relation is bijective.

\begin{solution}
We define the function $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ as follows: 
$$f(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{n+1}{2} & \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} \\ -\frac{n}{2} & \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \end{cases}$$
and its inverse $g:\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}$
$$g(z) = \begin{cases} -2z & \mbox{if }z \leq 0 \\ 2z-1& \mbox{if }z > 0 \end{cases}$$
Since we are able to define functions between the two sets in both directions, we have a bijection, and thus the two sets have the same cardinality.
\end{solution}

If you have a bijective function $f(x)$ and it?s inverse $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, prove that your function $g(x)$ both surjective and injective and is thus bijective.

\begin{solution}
\noindent We define $g$ as follows:
$$\forall y \in B, g(y) = x\text{, where }x \in A \wedge f(x) = y$$
\noindent Because $f$ is injective, every element in $B$ has at most arrow coming into it. Because $f$ is surjective, every element in $B$ has at least arrow coming into it. This means that every element in $B$ has exactly one arrow coming into it, and that you can uniquely trace an element in $B$ to the element in $A$ which maps to it.
\noindent Looking now at $g$, we see that $g$ is injective because every element in $A$ has at most one arrow coming in. We also see that $g$ is surjective because every element in $A$ has at least one arrow coming in.

\end{solution}
