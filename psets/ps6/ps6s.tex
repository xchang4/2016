\subproblem Determine the maximum number of edges in a DAG with $n$ vertices.
\subproblem Prove your answer using induction.  

\begin{solution}
\subsolution The maximum number of edges is is $n(n-1)/2$. 
\subsolution Base case: $n = 1$. Maximum number of edges is 0. 
Induction step: assume that for some DAG with $n$ vertices, the maximum number of edges is $n(n-1)/2$. We must prove that for $n+1$ vertices, the maximum number of edges will be $(n+1)(n)/2$. Let us consider our graph with $n$ vertices and add one additional vertex.  We want to maximize the number of edges in this new graph without creating a cycle. If we add an edge from our new vertex to every existing vertex in the graph, we will not create a cycle since there will be no way to return to our vertex. Thus, we will end up with $n(n-1)/2 + n$ edges, which is by simple algebra equal to $(n+1)(n)/2$.

A directed graph $G$ has a Euler Tour if and only if there is a closed walk in that graph that uses each edge exactly once, although it may visit vertices multiple times. Prove that if a graph has a Euler tour, then its in and out degrees are equal. (Hint: conceptualize a Euler tour that touches vertexes multiple times as a union of one or more walks that touch any node at most once)

\begin{solution}
Let us prove that if a graph $G$ has a Euler tour, then the in and out degrees of each vertex are equal. There are two cases: where our path passes through every vertex once and where it passes through some of these vertices multiple times.
If it passes through every vertex once (a simple tour), then the in degree and out degree of each vertex is one; the in and out degree of every vertex is equal by definition. Now let us consider a graph where some nodes have in and out degree more than one. We can conceptualize this more complex Euler tour as the union of simple Euler tours. We follow one simple Euler tour and then remove all the edges we followed. The nodes that remain connected will still have equal in an out degree, or they will be unconnected (in an out degree 0). We can continue this process until no nodes are connected; the final Euler tour will be the union of these simple Euler tours we constructed.

Determine whether each of the possible binary relations is an equivalence relation. If you do not believe that the relation is an equivalence, you should justify your answer by stating the properties of equivalance relations that the relation fails to satisfy. Otherwise, no justification is needed.

\subproblem The relation $R$ where $aRb \iff$ a is a sibling of b.
\subproblem The relation $R$ where $aRb \iff$ a is friends with b.
\subproblem The relation $R$ where $aRb$ for $a, b \in \{$ Rock, Paper, Scissors $\} \iff a$ beats $b$.
\subproblem The relation $R = \{(a, a), (a, c), (b, b), (c, c), (c, a) \}$ on the set $A = \{a, b, c\}$.
\subproblem The relation $R = \{(a, b), (a, a), (c, c), (a, c), (c, a), (b, a), (b, b) \}$ on the set $A = \{a, b, c\}$.

\solution

\subsolution This is not an equivalence relation, since the reflexive property does not hold (you are not your own sibiling).
\subsolution This is not an equivalence relation, since the reflexive and transitive properties do not hold (you are not friends with yourself, two people who share a friend do not necessarily have to be friends).
\subsolution This is not an equivalance relation, since none of the properties hold.
\subsolution This is an equivalence relation.
\subsolution This is not an equivalence relation, since the transitive property does not hold ($bTa$ and $aTc$ but it is not the case that $bTc$.

Consider the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ of all ordered pairs of positive integers. Show that the relation $(a, b) \sim (c,d) \iff ad = bc$ is an equivalence relation.

\solution

\subsolution Reflexifity: for a pair $(a, b)$ it is true that $ab = ba$, so $(a, b) \sim (a, b)$.
\subsolution Symmetry: if $(a, b) \sim (c, d)$, then $ad = bc$. This implies that $cb = da$ is true, so $(c, d) \sim (a, b)$.
\subsolution Transitivity: if $(a, b) \sim (c, d)$ and if $(c, d) \sim (e, f)$, then $ad = bc$ and $cf = de$. Multiplying the first equation by $f$ we get $adf = bcf$, and substituting for $cf$ from the second equation we get $adf = bde$. Since $d$ is not 0, we can cancel it from both sides to get $af = be$, which shows that $(a, b) \sim (e, f)$.
