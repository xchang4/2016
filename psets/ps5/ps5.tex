Show, by giving an example for each case, that the intersection of two uncountable sets can be: empty, finite, countably
infinite, or uncountably infinite.

\subproblem The Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem states that for sets $S$ and $T$, if there exist injective functions $f : S \rightarrow T$ and $g : T \rightarrow S$, then $S$ and $T$ have the same cardinality. Using the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem, show that the cardinality of the set of all real numbers between $0$ and $100$, inclusive, is the same as the cardinality of the set of all real numbers between, but not including, $0$ and $100$.

\subproblem Prove the finite case for the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem. That is, prove that for finite sets $S$ and $T$, if there exist injective functions $f : S \rightarrow T$ and $g : T \rightarrow S$, then sets $S$ and $T$ have the same cardinality. (HINT: Check out the warm-up proof from the Relations and Functions lesson for some inspiration!)

\problem{2+2}{1/2 page}
A robot wanders around a two-dimensional grid. The robot starts at (0,0) and is allowed to take four different types of steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (-2, +2)
\item (-4, +4)
\item (+1, -1)
\item (+3, -3)
\end{enumerate}
For example, the robot might take the following stroll. The types of steps are denoted by each arrow's subscript:
$$(0,0) \to_1 (-2,2) \to_3 (-1,1) \to_2 (-5,5) \to_4 (-2,2) \to \ldots$$

\subproblem Describe a state machine model of this problem.
\subproblem Will the robot ever reach (1, 2)? Either find an appropriate path for the robot or use the Invariant Principle to prove that no such path exists.

\problem{3+1}{1/2 page}
\subproblem Using string concatenation as the sole constructor, give a recursive definition of the set $S$ of bit strings with no more than a single 1 in them 

(e.g. 00010, 010, or 000)
\subproblem Is $0010\in S$? How can you derive it from your base case?

\problem{2+2}{1/2 page}
Let $A = \left\{ {5n:n\in\mathbb{N}}\right\}$ and let $S$ be the set defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Base Case: $5 \in S$
\item Constructor Rule: If $x\in S$ and $y\in S$, $x+y \in S$ 
\end{itemize}
\subproblem Use induction to prove that $A\subseteq S $.
\subproblem Use structural induction to prove that $S\subseteq A$.
