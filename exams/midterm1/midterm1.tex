\problem{}{} Let $A = \neg (\neg p \lor q) \to r$ and $B = \neg r \oplus (\neg p \land q)$. For which value(s) of $p, q$, and $r$ do $A$ and $B$ differ? Use a truth table.

\problem{}{} Perform the following operations in binary.

\subproblem $1111_2 + 1111_2$
\subproblem $1010_2 - 100_2$

\begin{solution}
  % Write your answer here.

\problem{}{} Let the domain of discourse be all Harvard CS courses. The predicate $P(c, d)$ means that course $c$ is a prerequisite for course $d$. Assume that it is not possible for a course to be a prerequesite of itself. Write the following English sentences using quantificational formulas.

\subproblem There is a course that is a prerequisite for every other course.
\subproblem At least one course is a prerequisite for exactly one other course.

\begin{solution}
  % Write your answer here.

\problem{}{} The Tribonacci numbers are defined by $T_0 = 1, T_1 = 1, T_2 = 2$, and $T_n = T_{n_1} + T_{n-2} + T_{n-3}$ for all $n \ge 3$. The beginning of the Tribonacci sequence is $1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, ...$. Use strong induction to prove that $T_n \le 3^n$ for all natural numbers $n$.

\begin{solution}
  % Write your answer here.
\end{solution}


\problem{}{}

Prove that in any group of six people, at least two of them know the same number of people. Note that you don't know yourself, and that if A knows B then B knows A (thus ``knows'' is a symmetric relation). 

\begin{solution}
  % Write your answer here.
