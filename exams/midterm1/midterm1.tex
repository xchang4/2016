\problem{}{} Let the domain of discourse be all Harvard CS courses. The predicate $P(c, d)$ means that course $c$ is a prerequisite for course $d$. Assume that it is not possible for a course to be a prerequisite of itself. Write the following English sentences using quantificational formulas.

\problem{}{}
Let $a_1=1$ and for every $k \geq 1$, $a_{k+1}=3a_k+1$. Prove that for every $k \geq1 $, $a_k$ is odd or even depending on whether $k$ is odd or even, respectively. You may assume that the product of an even number and another number is even, and the product of two odd numbers is odd.
